# Practice Labs

This folder contains a collection of **hands-on cybersecurity practice exercises**, independently executed to develop practical skills in offensive and defensive security.  

The exercises are based on publicly shared UWA CITS1003 labs and cover a wide range of topics, including penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, incident response, digital forensics, cryptography, social engineering, and IoT/CPS security.

## 📂 Practice Subfolders

Each subfolder contains a specific set of exercises:

- [Vulnerability Assessment Practice](./vulnerability-assessment-practice)  
- [Incident Response Practice](./incident-response-practice)  
- [Digital Forensics Practice](./digital-forensics-practice)  
- [Cryptography Practice](./cryptography-practice)
