# Penetration Testing Practice Labs

## Objective
Practice exercises focused on identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in simulated environments. Inspired by publicly shared CITS1003 labs.

## Skills Practiced
- Network reconnaissance & enumeration (Nmap)
- Web application testing (OWASP Top 10)
- Vulnerability identification & classification
- Basic exploitation techniques
- Privilege escalation concepts

## Tools Used
- Nmap
- Metasploit
- Burp Suite
- Linux CLI

## Notes
These exercises were executed independently to build hands-on familiarity with penetration testing methodology.
